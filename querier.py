# The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible.
    # Sometimes this behaviour isnâ€™t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against <a> b <c>, it
    # will match the entire string, and not just <a>. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform
    # the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched.
    # Using the RE <.*?> will match only <a>.
